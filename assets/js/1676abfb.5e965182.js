Instead of learning organization-specific APIs, researchers ask questions in natural language: "Find seismic data from the Yellowstone region updated in the last month." An AI agent interprets this query, figures out that EarthScope hosts seismic data, searches their catalog for Yellowstone region stations, filters by update date, and returns a list of available datasets.
