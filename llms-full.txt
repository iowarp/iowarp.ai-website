## 1. Project Identity

IOWarp is an NSF-funded ($5M, Award #2411318, 2024-2029) open-source context engineering platform for autonomous AI agents in scientific computing and high-performance computing (HPC).

- **Project Name**: IOWarp
- **Software Platform Name**: CLIO (Context Layer for IO)
- **Tagline**: "Context Engineering for Autonomous AI Agents"
- **Core Message**: IOWarp bridges the gap between petabyte-scale scientific data and AI-ready intelligence through context engineering — transforming scattered data, metadata, telemetry, and computational state into unified, actionable context for autonomous agents.
- **Website**: https://iowarp.ai
- **License**: BSD 3-Clause
- **Funding**: NSF Award #2411318 ($5M, 2024–2029)
- **Evolution**: Hermes (2018) → LABIOS (2019) → IOWarp (2025)

### Why "CLIO"?
CLIO stands for "Context Layer for IO." The name is a deliberate nod to Clio (Κλειώ), the Greek muse of history — daughter of Zeus and Mnemosyne (Memory). In ancient mythology, Clio was "the proclaimer" who preserved, celebrated, and made knowledge accessible across time. CLIO transforms raw I/O into rich, actionable context for AI agents, just as the muse transformed events into enduring knowledge.
