## Core Architecture

- **Intelligence Layer**: ClaudIO agent framework — autonomous agents for scientific data management
- **Tooling Layer**: Agent Toolkit — 15+ MCP servers with 150+ tools for scientific computing
- **Storage Layer**: Context engines (CAE, CTE, CEI, PPI) — multi-tier orchestration from GPU HBM to tape

## Four Engines

- **CAE (Content Assimilation Engine)**: "The Way In" — ingests 50+ scientific formats (HDF5, NetCDF, ROOT)
- **CTE (Content Transfer Engine)**: "The Mover" — ML-based predictive data movement across storage tiers
- **CEI (Content Exploration Interface)**: "The Finder" — WarpGPT natural language queries at petabyte scale
- **PPI (Platform Plugins Interface)**: "The Connector" — HPC scheduler/storage/instrument integration

## Key Metrics

7.5x faster workflows, 2.6x DRAM reduction, 150+ tools, 25+ papers, 2 Best Paper Awards, 1 US Patent, $15M cumulative research funding, deployed at 3 national labs (LLNL, ANL, NERSC)
